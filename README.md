# Movie_Recommendation_System
## Overview:
This repository contains a content-based movie recommendation system implemented using Python. The system suggests movies to users based on the content of the movies they have previously liked or rated.
## Features:
1) Utilizes movie metadata such as genre, director, actors, and plot keywords to recommend similar movies.
2) Implements cosine similarity to measure the similarity between movies based on their content features.
3) Provides personalized recommendations for users based on their historical preferences.
4) Includes a user-friendly interface for users to input their movie preferences and receive recommendations.
## Technologies Used:
Python for data processing, recommendation algorithm implementation, and user interface development.
Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn for cosine similarity calculation.
Flask for building the web interface.
## How to Use:
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
Run the app.py file to start the Flask server.
Access the web interface in your browser and input your movie preferences.
Receive personalized movie recommendations based on the content of the movies you like.
## Future Improvements:
Incorporate collaborative filtering techniques for more accurate recommendations.
Enhance the user interface for a more interactive experience.
Scale the system to handle larger movie datasets efficiently.
